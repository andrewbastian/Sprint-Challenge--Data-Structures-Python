# Task 2. Runtime Optimization

"""
Navigate into the `names` directory. Here you will find two text files
containing 10,000 names each, along with a program `names.py` that compares
the two files and prints out duplicate name entries. Try running the code with
`python3 names.py`. Be patient because it might take a while: approximately
six seconds on my laptop. What is the runtime complexity of this code?

Six seconds is an eternity so you've been tasked with speeding up the code.
Your goal is to use one of the data structures we built out over the course of
this week in order to optimize and improve on the runtime so that it's more
efficient than O(nÂ²).

A follow-up question to think about: _*once you've used one of the data
structures we implemented over the course of the week*_ in order to improve
the runtime of the implementation, what other data structures (including ones
from Python's standard library) are also possible candidates for improving the
runtime of the implementation?

# ---------- Stretch Goal -----------
# Python has built-in tools allowing a efficient approach to this problem
# What's the best time you can accomplish?
# Thare are no restrictions on techniques or data structures,
